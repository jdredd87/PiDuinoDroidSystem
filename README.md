# PiDuinoDroidSystem
My DIY Home Garage Opener 

* Main purpose of this was to not only build a possibly over complex garage door opener, but to mix a few technologies together.
* Delphi FMX, FreePascal, Rasperry Pi and Arduino hardware *
* To show how these different peices could be used in a close system together *

I have a "dumb" garage door opener system, and doing small tests, was able to open them with an Arduino and relays.

So I figured I would try and tie this all up together making it overly complicated with Pi's and Arduinos and other parts that I already had laying around.

This is built to be customized to my setup. So no easy to use interfaces to add/remove/configure ect. All will be hard coded. At least in the very beginning to get stuff actually working. But I hope it gives people an idea down the road what can be done.

Some things I will be long hand coding until I am happy then will see about going back around to optimize. 

<b>Arduino IDE</b> for Arduino Programming

<b>Embarcadero Delphi</b> for any and all Android/iOS/Win32 Programming

<b>FreePascal / Lazarus</b> for ARM Linux Programming

------------------------------------

<b>Arduino.GarageOpener</b> - Arduino Nano - Controller for running relays, DHT11 Temp/Humidity Sensor, and RCWL Microwave Radar motion sensor.

<b>PiServer.GarageOpener</b> - Pi 3 B+ - 3.5" Touch Screen Pi running a simple HTTP Web Server to allow incoming connection calls. Communicates USB>Serial to Arduino.GarageOpener.
